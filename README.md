> Vision & Language models (VLMs) have proved effective
at aligning image and text representations, producing superior
zero-shot results when transferred to many downstream
tasks. However, these representations suffer some key shortcomings
in Compositional Language Concepts (CLC) understanding
such as recognizing objects’ attributes, states, and relations
between different objects. Moreover, VLMs typically
have poor interpretability, making it challenging to debug and
mitigate compositional-understanding failures. In this work,
we introduce the Tree-augmented Vision & Language (3VL)
model architecture and training technique. By expanding the
text of an arbitrary image-text pair into a hierarchical tree
structure using language analysis tools, 3VL allows inducing
this structure into the visual representation learned by
the model, enhancing its compositional reasoning and interpretability.
Overall, we provide a novel approach for improving
performance and explainablity of VLMs.

technique allows for rich exploration of the text space using several levels of incremental text augmentation from coarse to fine-grained.
